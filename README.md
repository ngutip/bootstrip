# About

Bootstrip is a wordpress skeleton for initialize a wordpress project, its base on bootstrap, H5BP, initializr, and basically its a strip down version from [rootsthemes] (http://www.rootsthemes.com)by Ben Word.

its a simple by design, just add content-{post-type name}.php or content-{single name}.php or content-{archive name}.php, its automatically route to that file. 

Just like rootsthemes we also use [scribu's theme wrapper] (http://scribu.net/wordpress/theme-wrappers.html), wrapper.php is serving all templates request.
